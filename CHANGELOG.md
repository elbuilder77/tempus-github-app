# Changelog

All notable changes to `tempus-github-app` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Thread comments, issue/PR labels, and review requests with strict input validation and sanitized outcomes.
- Pull request merges with mandatory 40-character HEAD SHA, explicit merge method, repository-scoped `contents: write` tokens, and confirmation of boolean `merged: true`.
- Per-execution permit context and bounded GitHub rate-limit retries with read-only Gate revocation checks, complete server-required waits, and no retries after ambiguous results.
- Merge setup guidance for accepting new installation permissions and configuring tenant approval policy.

### Fixed

- Pin the compatible Tempus runtime source and configure Rust in CI; PyPI 0.5.1 does not support the required `gate_db` constructor argument.
- Reject configured `gate_db` when the underlying runtime cannot support revocation verification.
- Classify unmergeable PRs (405) and changed HEAD commits (409) as deterministic failures.
- Suppress arbitrary transport error messages from signed outcomes.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added
- **Credential-Isolated Mediated Execution**: Decouple privileged GitHub operations from AI agents. Agents sign Ed25519 intents without credentials; the executor holds the GitHub App RSA private key and performs authorized writes.
- **Short-Lived Installation Tokens**: Generates 1-hour, repository- and permission-scoped tokens (`issues: write`, `pull_requests: write`) on demand via RS256 JWT exchange, refreshed 60 seconds before expiration.
- **Atomic Single-Use Consumption**: Permits issued by the Tempus Gate are consumed atomically in SQLite; duplicate or replayed permit executions fail closed immediately.
- **Protocol Conformance Suite**: Certified against the official `tempus_ddb.testing.AdapterConformanceHarness` ensuring full compliance with Tempus zero-trust security invariants.
- **End-to-End B2A Lifecycle Integration**: Tested against real `TempusDDB` instances for intent signing, permit issuance, execution, outcome signing, trace verification, and incomplete execution recovery (`recover_incomplete`).
- **Standardized CLI (`tempus-github-app-executor`)**:
  - Full CLI parameter and environment variable fallback support (`.env` file compatible).
  - Optional `--gate-db` parameter for direct revocation and replay cross-verification against Gate databases.
  - `--version` flag and structured exit codes (0 for success, 1 for errors, 2 for ambiguous `UNKNOWN` outcomes).
  - Stdin support (`--permit -`) for direct piping in automated agent pipelines.
- **FastAPI Webhook Server (`tempus-github-app-server`)**:
  - Optional server entrypoint for receiving and dispatching GitHub App webhook events.
  - Strict HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (`X-Hub-Signature-256`).
  - GitHub `ping` event handling and `/healthz` health check endpoint for orchestrators.
- **Multi-OS GitHub Actions CI**: Automated test matrix running on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS across Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 with `ruff` and `pytest`.

### Fixed
- **Pytest Root Resolution**: Included repository root (`.`) in `tool.pytest.ini_options.pythonpath` so `pytest tests/ -v` can import `tests.conftest` fixtures without requiring `python -m pytest`.
- **Webhook Error Sanitization**: Replaced unhandled exception reflection in FastAPI webhook server (`/webhook`) with a generic error message (`Error handling event`) while capturing full traces in server logs, preventing internal information disclosure.
