## 🔒 Overview

**Tempus GitHub App** decouples GitHub privileged operations from autonomous AI agents. Rather than provisioning personal access tokens (PATs) directly to agents or runners:

1. **Requesting Agents** sign an **Intent** declaring the requested repository action without holding GitHub credentials.
2. **Tempus Gate** evaluates cryptographic tenant policy and grants an expiring, single-use signed **Permit**.
3. **Tempus GitHub App Executor** validates the permit, atomically consumes it, and mints short-lived (1-hour), installation- and repository-scoped GitHub App tokens using an RSA private key.
4. **Execution Outcomes** are signed and recorded into the Tempus immutable decision ledger.

Neither the GitHub App private key nor ephemeral installation tokens ever leak to the requesting agent or execution receipts.

## ⚡ Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
# or with optional webhook server:
pip install -e ".[server]"
# or for running tests and development:
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Requires Python 3.10+, Git, and the stable Rust toolchain to build the pinned
`tempus-ddb` runtime. The dependency currently points to commit
`95e792be4dda22bf65963896a81191d0d0cef094` (0.5.2 source), which supports
`gate_db`; the published 0.5.1 runtime lacks that constructor argument.
Keep the source pin until a compatible release is published and verified.

---

## 🚀 Quick Usage

### 1. Configure the Executor
Ensure you have registered a GitHub App and installed it on your repository (see [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)).

You can configure credentials either via CLI arguments or environment variables (`.env` supported):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your App Client ID, private key path, installation ID, repository, and Gate ID
```

### 2. Execute a Signed Permit via CLI
Given a signed permit `permit.json` issued by the Tempus Gate for `github.create_issue`:

```bash
# Using CLI arguments:
tempus-github-app-executor \
  --permit permit.json \
  --executor-db executor.db \
  --executor-keyfile executor.keys.json \
  --gate-id <GATE_PUBLIC_KEY> \
  --tenant-id <TENANT_ID> \
  --app-client-id <APP_CLIENT_ID> \
  --app-private-key /path/to/private-key.pem \
  --installation-id 12345678 \
  --repository owner/repo

# Or with environment variables configured in .env:
tempus-github-app-executor --permit permit.json
```

Accepts `stdin` via `--permit -` for piping directly from `tempus request-action`.

### 3. Optional: Webhook Receiver Server

Run the FastAPI-based webhook receiver to securely verify GitHub webhook deliveries:

```bash
tempus-github-app-server --secret <WEBHOOK_SECRET> --port 8000
```

* `POST /webhook`: Validates `X-Hub-Signature-256` HMAC-SHA256 signature, dispatches events, and masks internal errors with generic responses.
* `GET /healthz`: Health check endpoint for container orchestrators.

### 4. Python SDK Integration

```python
from tempus_github_app import GitHubAppCredentials, GitHubAppExecutorAdapter

credentials = GitHubAppCredentials(
    client_id="Iv1.xxxx",
    private_key_path="secrets/app.pem",
    installation_id=12345678,
    repository="owner/repo",
)

executor = GitHubAppExecutorAdapter(
    executor_db="executor.db",
    executor_keyfile="executor.keys.json",
    trusted_gate_id=gate_public_key,
    trusted_tenant_id="tenant-1",
    credentials=credentials,
)

outcome_json = executor.execute(permit_json)
```

## 🛡️ Security Guarantees & Invariants

### Supported actions

All actions require an exact `owner/repository` resource in the signed intent.
Unknown input fields are rejected before requesting installation credentials.

| Action | Required input | Installation permission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `github.create_issue` | `title` | `issues: write` |
| `github.create_pull_request` | `title`, `head`, `base` | `pull_requests: write` |
| `github.add_comment` | Positive integer `issue_number`, non-empty `body` (up to 65,536 characters) | `issues: write` |
| `github.add_labels` | Positive integer `issue_number`, non-empty list of non-empty `labels` | `issues: write` |
| `github.request_review` | Positive integer `pull_number`, at least one non-empty list of `reviewers` or `team_reviewers` | `pull_requests: write` |
| `github.merge_pull_request` | Positive integer `pull_number`, 40-character hexadecimal HEAD `sha`, explicit `merge_method` (`merge`, `squash`, `rebase`) | `contents: write` |

Comments are conversation-thread comments on issues or pull requests. Review
requests accept user logins and team slugs. Label outcomes include only label
IDs, names, and colors; comment and review-request outcomes retain only selected
resource metadata, excluding comment bodies and user profiles.

Merges accept optional string `commit_title` and `commit_message`. They succeed only
when GitHub explicitly returns boolean `merged: true`. Existing Apps must add
`contents: write`, and existing installations must accept the updated permissions.
Configure Gate policy to restrict merges to integration/release-manager identities
and require human approval for protected branches before issuing permits; this
executor does not configure that governance. See [merge setup](docs/SETUP.md#6-enable-governed-pull-request-merges).

* **Zero Credential & Information Leakage**: The agent never receives GitHub tokens. The executor process handles authentication internally, and the webhook server sanitizes error responses to prevent internal detail disclosure.
* **Scope Minimization**: Tokens are generated on-demand with minimal repository and permission scope (`issues: write`, `pull_requests: write`, or `contents: write` for merges).
* **Redirect Shielding**: Enforces strict redirect blocking (`RejectRedirects`) on API calls to prevent credential forwarding to third-party endpoints.
* **Replay Protection**: The underlying Tempus permit is consumed atomically; replay attempts fail immediately without contacting GitHub.
* **Adapter Conformance**: Validated against the official `tempus_ddb.testing.AdapterConformanceHarness` conformance suite.

## Permit-bounded rate-limit retries

The executor supplies a per-execution `PermitContext` only from the runtime's
post-verification, post-consumption adapter callback. Its deadline comes from
the signed authorization (`expires_at` in microseconds, converted to UNIX seconds).
The same permit is never consumed again for a retry.

Configure `--gate-db` (or SDK `gate_db`) to enable up to three rate-limit retries.
Each attempt checks expiry and queries the Gate database read-only for permit
revocation, agent identity revocation, and an already committed outcome. Missing
databases, incompatible schemas, locks, and failed checks stop execution. Without
`gate_db`, requests receive a single attempt.

The transport respects `Retry-After` and primary rate-limit reset times. A
secondary limit without a wait header starts at 60 seconds, with exponential
backoff, following [GitHub's retry guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api).
It never shortens GitHub's wait to fit a permit. Expiry or revocation during a
wait prevents the next request. Socket timeouts are capped at 30 seconds and the
remaining budget; less than one second remaining stops the attempt rather than
rounding its timeout above the deadline. These are socket timeouts, not a guarantee
that an in-flight remote operation will finish before expiry.

Ordinary permission-denied responses and exhausted rate-limit budgets yield
`FAILED`. Network failures, timeouts, malformed success responses, and HTTP 5xx
yield `UNKNOWN` without automatic replay; reconciliation must use read-only calls.

Custom transports should accept `request(..., *, context: PermitContext | None = None)`
and enforce this contract. Legacy transports without that argument remain usable
without `gate_db`; configuring active revocation with such a transport fails closed.
The bundled bridge supports the SQLite revocation schema used by `tempus-ddb`;
it does not alter the installed runtime or its verification and signing logic.
